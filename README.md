# AppTeamTimey
Final Project for IOS Academy for App Team Carolina

A countdown timer for all of any time senitive needs. Has a start and and rest option.
As well as a slide where you can choose at what minuet does your timer start. Max of 1 hour.
In addition there is a video on the background as a little bonus.

Note: Due to the limitations of my Macbook Air I could not go further into the video side of the project. 
The laptop would crash and shutdown. Until I get a new Macbook Pro with some high specs this is all I can do for now. 
Hope that this project works on your machine.

Thank you!
